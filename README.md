# VoteIndiaApp
A lot of people tend to associate smart contracts with financial matters what they don’t know is that decentralized apps can be used in many more ways.

In our project, we illustrate the use of blockchain for electronic voting. The most important things to ensure in online voting are: correct and anonymous assignment of votes cast by a user, automatic vote counting, transparent process.

We have also created a two factor authentication process to confirm the user’s identity before they are allowed to cast their vote.

The first step will be a simple OTP verification which has been built using a firebase.

The second will be facial recognition with the following key features:​
* It recognizes faces very accurately​
* It works offline, in real time​
* It uses a mobile-oriented deep  learning architecture​
Once the user goes through the verification process he/she will be directed to a page where they can cast their vote.
Key Features:
* Anonymous Votes
* Extremely Secure
* Completely Decentralised

The user will be directed to a confirmation pop-up for their vote.
Upon confirmation the app will access the solidity smart contract deployed on the matic test server and cast the vote.
