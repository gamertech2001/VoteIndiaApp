# VoteIndiaApp
A lot of people tend to associate smart contracts with financial matters what they don’t know is that decentralized apps can be used in many more ways.​
In our project, we illustrate the use of blockchain for electronic voting. The most important things to ensure in online voting are: correct and anonymous assignment of votes cast by a user, automatic vote counting, transparent process. ​
We have also created a two factor authentication process to confirm the user’s identity before they are allowed to cast their vote.​
The first step will be a simple OTP verification which has been built using a firebase.​
The second will be facial recognition with the following key features:​
* It recognizes faces very accurately​
* It works offline, in real time​
* It uses a mobile-oriented deep  learning architecture​
