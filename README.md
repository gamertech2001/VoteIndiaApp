A lot of people tend to associate smart contracts with financial matters what they don’t is that decentralized apps can be used in many more ways.​
With our project, we illustrate the use of blockchain for electronic voting. The most important things to ensure in online voting are: correct  and anonymous assignment of votes cast by a user, automatic vote counting, transparent process. ​
We have also created a two factor authentication Process to confirm the user’s identity before they are allowed to cast their vote.​
